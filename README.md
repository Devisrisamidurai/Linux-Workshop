## 🌟 Why You Should Learn Linux?  

As per Stack Overflow’s insights, the most common and most loved platform happens to be **Linux**. If you do a quick search online on Linux, you’ll come across some fascinating statistics:  

- 🖥️ **All of the fastest 500 supercomputers** in the world run on Linux.  
- 🌐 **96.3% of the top 1 million web servers** run on Linux.  
- 📱 **86% of all smartphones** are powered by Linux.  

In the **cloud** and **DevOps world**, many modern tools are developed and used in Linux environments first before they are made available on Windows.  

For example:  
- ⚡ **Containerization tools** like Docker were initially exclusive to Linux-based systems.  
- 🤖 **Automation tools** like Ansible require a Linux environment for the Ansible controller (even though Ansible can manage Windows systems as targets).
